Kosma System Architecture

Overview

Kosma is a decentralized social media platform designed to prioritize user privacy, content ownership, and a fair monetization model for content creators. By leveraging blockchain technology, Kosma allows users to mint their content as NFTs, ensuring full ownership and control, while also incorporating a novel revenue model that relies on cryptocurrency mining, without traditional advertisements. The system is designed to be decentralized, secure, and scalable, with cross-chain compatibility and integrations.

System Components

1. Frontend
Tech Stack: React.js, LedgerJS, Lit Protocol, Tailwind CSS

User Interaction: Users interact with the platform through the web interface built with React.js. The frontend communicates with the backend for API requests and interacts with smart contracts through Web3.js and ethers.js for blockchain transactions.
Wallet Integration: Integration with LedgerJS allows users to securely manage their private keys and interact with the platform using their Ledger hardware wallet.
Encryption: Lit Protocol is used to encrypt sensitive data, such as private comments and payments, providing a layer of security in interactions between users.

2. Backend
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Web3.js, The Graph, XMTP

Responsibilities: The backend is responsible for handling API requests, managing user authentication (JWT), facilitating communication with smart contracts, and managing interactions with the database.
Database: MongoDB stores user profiles, NFT metadata, payment histories, and licensing information.
XMTP for Encrypted Communication: The backend integrates XMTP for sending encrypted messages between users, ensuring private and secure communication.
API Gateway: Provides endpoints for the frontend to interact with smart contracts, manage user data, and handle NFT transactions.

3. Blockchain Layer
Tech Stack: Solidity (for Ethereum and Polygon), Cadence (for Flow), LayerZero, Unlock Protocol, Story Protocol

Smart Contracts: Kosma uses multiple smart contracts to manage NFTs, payments, licensing, and membership models.
KosmaNFT.sol: Manages NFT minting, transfers, royalties, and licensing.
KosmaPayments.sol: Handles payments using Circle USDC and Superfluid for streaming payments.
StoryIntegration.sol: Integrates Story Protocol for content licensing and royalty management.
UnlockProtocol.sol: Manages memberships using NFT-based models.
Blockchain Networks: Kosma operates across multiple blockchain networks—Ethereum, Polygon, and Flow—for NFT creation, licensing, and transfers. LayerZero V2 is utilized to enable omnichain communication between these networks.

4. Cross-Chain Integration
Tech Stack: LayerZero V2, Flow, Ethereum, Polygon

LayerZero V2: Provides omnichain communication, enabling seamless interaction of assets (NFTs) between different blockchains. This integration allows users to transfer NFTs from Flow to Ethereum and Polygon, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across chains.

5. Membership and Licensing
Tech Stack: Unlock Protocol, Story Protocol

Unlock Protocol: Handles memberships by allowing content creators to mint NFT-based membership tokens that grant exclusive access to premium content.
Story Protocol: Facilitates content licensing, royalty distribution, and management of content rights. Creators can define reuse permissions and royalties, and Story Protocol ensures transparency in licensing agreements and royalties.

Data Flow
General Data Flow Overview
Frontend Interaction: A user interacts with the frontend by performing actions such as minting an NFT, purchasing a membership, or transferring tokens.
API Requests: The frontend sends a request to the backend API, which is responsible for processing the request and interacting with the blockchain.
Blockchain Transaction: For blockchain-related actions (e.g., NFT minting or royalty payments), the backend interacts with smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, or Flow.
Data Storage: Metadata related to NFTs and user actions is stored in MongoDB. Any blockchain events, such as token transfers, are indexed using The Graph.
Response: The backend returns a response to the frontend, completing the user’s interaction.

Key User Actions
Minting an NFT
The user creates a new post and selects the option to mint it as an NFT.
The frontend sends the request to the backend.
The backend interacts with the KosmaNFT.sol contract, minting the NFT on the blockchain.
The NFT metadata is stored in MongoDB, and the transaction details are indexed by The Graph for future queries.
The frontend displays the minted NFT to the user.
Purchasing Memberships
The user selects a membership from a content creator.
The frontend sends a request to the backend, which interacts with the UnlockProtocol.sol contract to mint the membership NFT.
The membership information is recorded in the MongoDB database, and access rights are granted to the user based on their membership level.

Transferring Tokens
The user initiates a token transfer (e.g., an NFT) from Flow to Ethereum.
LayerZero handles the cross-chain communication and ensures that the asset is transferred securely.
The backend records the transfer in MongoDB and updates the user’s asset balance accordingly.
(Include flowcharts or diagrams for these data flows)

Interactions Between Components
Frontend to Backend: The frontend interacts with the backend through RESTful APIs. The backend is responsible for handling requests related to user management, content interactions, and NFT transactions.

Backend to Smart Contracts: The backend uses Web3.js or ethers.js to interact with smart contracts. For cross-chain operations, LayerZero’s omnichain messaging ensures smooth interaction between different blockchains.

The Graph: The Graph is used to index smart contract events, making it easier to query blockchain transactions (e.g., NFT minting, royalty payments).
Encrypted Communication (XMTP): The XMTP protocol is used for secure, encrypted messaging between users.

Security Considerations

LedgerJS Integration
Ledger Integration: Users can connect their Ledger hardware wallets for secure transactions, ensuring that private keys are never exposed.
Cold Storage: Sensitive keys are stored in cold storage using Ledger, preventing unauthorized access.

Lit Protocol Encryption
Data Encryption: Sensitive data, such as private messages and comments, are encrypted using Lit Protocol before being stored on-chain or in the database. Only authorized users can decrypt the content.

Smart Contract Security
AccessControl: Role-based access is implemented using OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl to ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions, such as minting or managing NFTs.
ReentrancyGuard: The ReentrancyGuard contract is used to prevent reentrancy attacks during token transfers and payment distributions.

Conclusion
Kosma’s system architecture is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and decentralized social media platform that gives users full control over their content. By leveraging blockchain technology and integrating cross-chain solutions, Kosma enables creators to monetize their work while ensuring privacy and ownership of digital assets.
